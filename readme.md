# recursion
My solutions for TOP's Recursion assignments

## Fibonacci Sequence
I create 2 functions to get a specified number in the fibonacci sequence both iteratively and recursively. The iterative version works as expected, but the recursive version is always one number off in the sequence and im not sure why. So I guess I didnt COMPLETELY solve the assignment. D:

## Merge Sort
This assignment gave me a hard time but I did eventually figure it out. It appears I didnt solve it as elegantly or cleanly as some of the other students but this is my solution and it works.

### Note
I've been wondering this whole time how to run plain JS files without connecting it to an HTML file and NOW TOP tells me. 
Run 'node (file)' in the console while in the repository.
